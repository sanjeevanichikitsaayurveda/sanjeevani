            <h2>Ayurvedic Approach to Diabetes</h2>
            <p>
              Diabetes (Madhumeha in Ayurveda) is characterized by high blood sugar levels and 
              requires a comprehensive management approach. At Sanjeevani Chikitsa Ayurveda, 
              we offer natural, effective treatments that complement conventional medical care 
              and focus on addressing the root causes of the condition.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding Diabetes from an Ayurvedic Perspective</h3>
            <p>
              Ayurveda views diabetes as a disorder resulting from imbalances in the Kapha and 
              Pitta doshas, along with diminished Ojas (vital energy). Our approach focuses on 
              restoring these imbalances through a combination of herbal remedies, dietary changes, 
              and lifestyle modifications tailored to your specific constitution.
            </p>
